# BOTANIC HUB üåø - client

This responsive app was born from my love for tea and interest in natural medicine. The idea eventually evolved to focus on plants and their medicinal benefits. Thus Botanic Hub is an informational resource for medicinal herbs and plants. It allows users to look for a specific health concern and returns a list of plants that could be used as treatment. Upon selecting a specific plant, the app renders its description, image, and other health uses.

Axios is used to make API calls to the server side.

Here is an example:

  useEffect(() => {
    const apiBody = process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL;
    const renderplantDetails = async () => {
      let response = await axios.get(`${apiBody}/plantdetails?plant=${plant}`);
      setPlantDetails(response.data);
    };
    renderplantDetails();

## Next Steps

Based on the feedback received, the next feature I would like to implement would be to render actual products users could reference. For instance, if a user clicks on 'eucalyptus', aside from the plant description, they would also see a list of eucalyptus products such as tea, oil, and essence. This would make the app more useful and would bring the user a step closer to treating their health issue.
